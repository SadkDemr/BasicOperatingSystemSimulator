#### Project topic: 
In this project, we will implement an Event Simulator that simulates a small set of events in a simple operating system.

#### Fiction: 
There will be different event types in the project for now; A system skeleton has been created in the form of a memory that holds the process start, process end, system call, system time and event processes. New functions and new structures will be added in the course of the project. These functions will run randomly and the functions will be returned. There will be functions in separate header files for all these events, they will be read.

Skills: C
